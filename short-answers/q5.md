# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

The two arguments that we pass into `fetch` is the URL and options. The URL tells `fetch` which website to send the request to. The options are boilerplate and contains a method, body, and headers. The method is the HTTP verbs, the body is the data that is being sent, and the headers provides metadata such as the formatting of the body's data. What `fetch` returns a promise that contains the HTTP Response.

# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

The "Request/Response Cycle" is when the client, or the program/computer, sends out a request to a server that returns a response back to the client. The response is being sent in a readable stream format. Important properties of the response are the request URL, request verb, response body code, and response body. The different requests that a client are represented through fetch methods such as GET, POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE.

This is really good. You glossed over the request part, can you add some more details of the kinds of requests a client can send.

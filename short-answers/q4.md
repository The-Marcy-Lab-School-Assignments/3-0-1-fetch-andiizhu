# Question

Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

1. 200 - OK - the request was succesful and the server is returning a response.

2. 201 - CREATED - the request was succesful and new resource was created.

3. 204 - NO CONTENT - the request was succesful but it is not returning any data - server side has nothing to send as response.

4. 404 - NOT FOUND - the server can't find the URL in the request, it means that the resource is missing.

5. 500 - INTERNAL SERVER CODE - the server is not able to compelete the request - catch-all status.

# Teacher Feedback
Saw this a few times so I'll just bring it up: its "successful" not "succesful". Solid answers here!
